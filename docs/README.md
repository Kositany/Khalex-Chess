# Khalex Chess E-commerce System

## Overview

This directory contains documentation for the Khalex Chess e-commerce platform, including current implementation details and future development roadmaps.

## Current System

### Call-to-Order Shop
The current implementation uses a **call-to-order system** where customers:
1. Browse products and add items to cart
2. Use contact methods (phone, WhatsApp, email) to place orders
3. Receive manual confirmation and delivery arrangements
4. Pay on delivery (cash or M-Pesa)

### Key Features
- **Product Catalog**: Chess boards, bags, and clocks
- **Shopping Cart**: Persistent cart using localStorage
- **Contact Integration**: Direct phone, WhatsApp, and email links
- **Order Compilation**: Automatic order summary generation for contact

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Vue 3 with Composition API
- **State Management**: Pinia stores
- **Animations**: GSAP with optimized performance
- **Styling**: SCSS with CSS custom properties
- **Build Tool**: Vite

## Documentation Files
